- In linux file extenction never matter
- sample.txt file name always diffrent to SAMPLE.txt and Sample.txt

uname :is a command and that is the first word of a command line syntax.
uname -a
unmae --all
uname -i

ls -l : Get list of files with long format, usually shows properties of a file  
ls -d
ls -A  : list of hidden files and directories
ls -a
ls -t
ls -r

ls -Al or ls =A -l : no diffrence between these two commands


cat sample.txt  : to pring contect of file
lsblk : to check disk information

touch abc.txt  : to create file we can use touch
touch abc.txt sample.xml xyz.py : we can create multiple files in a single time


rm : to remove file(s)

rm sample.txt : it delete file but before deleting it will ask for the confirmation
rm -f sample.txt : force remove. no confirmation
rm -rf dir : removes directory forcefully and recursively

cp <source_file> <destination_file>  : copy filr from one location to other location
cp sample.txt sample1.txt
cp -r dir1 dir2 - copy one directory content to other : 'r' is for recursive

"cp" - behaves based on the Target Directory

	if TARGET exists and if it is a file then it is invalid operation.
	if TARGET exists and if it is a dir then it copies the file inside the directory.
	if TARGET doesnt exist then it will copy the directory to that TATGET name

mv <source_file> <destination_file>  - is nothig but renamming the file
mv sample.txt sample1.txt
mv <soyrce dir> <Target Dir> - rename directory

pwd : display current working directory

cd .. : go to the parent directory
cd : go to home directory of user
cd /bin : move to bin location 

mkdir : to create directory

head <file name> : it diplays first 10 lines of code
head -n 5 <file name> : it diplays first 5 lines of code

tail <file name> : it diplays last 10 lines of code
tail -n 5 <file name> : it diplays last 5 lines of code


grep  : to serch particular string in file
grep root /etc/passwd : serch string "root" in passswd file

awk : to filter content
Example: sample.txt
1:abc:123
2:bcd:321
3:cde:432

awk -F : '{print $1,$2}' sample.txt - output: 1, abc and 2, bcd and 3, cde

VIM Editor : We can edit the file by and save the changes by following instructions.

vim file -> Press Insert or i -> Make Changes -> Press ESC -> Press Colon : -> Press wq -> Done

We can come out of file without saving the changes

vim file -> Press Insert or i -> Make Changes -> Press ESC -> Press Colon : -> Press q!

sed : one more editor to update file content at rum time
	sed -i -e "1d" sample.txt : delete first line on file
	sed -i -e "5d" sample.txt : delete fifth line on file
	sed -i -e "/string/d" sample.txt : delete line based on string
	
	sed -i -e "1 a I am new line" sample.txt : adding new line content at first line
	sed -i -e "5 a i am new line" sample.txt : adding new line content at fifth line
	sed -i -e "/mongod a i am new mongod" sample.txt : adding new line based on string content
	
	-sed -i -e "s|Hello|g" sample.txt : delete word "Hello" from file
	
	-sed -i -e "s|Hello|sample" sample.txt : replace word "Hello" with "sample" in file
	
find :  search for file

	find / -name sample.txt : search for "sample.txt" file in whole directory
	find /etc -name sample.txt : search for "sample.txt" file in /etc directory
	
curl :  curl to browse and download
	curl https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.0.0-RC1/bin/apache-tomcat-8.0.0-RC1-deployer.tar.gz 
		-o apache-tomcat-8.0.0-RC1-deployer.tar.gz : download the file "-o" option for setting file name -
		in windows like save as
	curl -O https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.0.0-RC1/bin/apache-tomcat-8.0.0-RC1-deployer.tar.gz 
		: same effect as above - in windows like save
		
tar : extract tar file 
	tar -xf <filename>.tar.gz  : -x for extract, -f file, -c compress
	
unzip : extract zip files

pipes : is nothing but output of one pipe is input to other
	ls -l|find sample.txt
	
	echo sample.txt | rm -f   : it will not work - when ever pipe not supporting we can use "xargs"
	echo sample.txt | xargs rm -f  : this will works
	unzip <file name>
